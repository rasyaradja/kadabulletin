# Secret Board

An anonymous web app where users can post virtual 'post-it notes' onto a public bulletin board. It's designed for sharing secret confessions or messages. Users can also post replies, which appear as new, separate notes linked to the original, creating a sense of anonymous conversation.

## Features

-   **Anonymous Posting**: Users can post notes without creating an account or providing any identifying information.
-   **Answer Post Reply System**: Users can reply to any note. A reply is created as a brand new post-it note that appears on the main board, but it contains a link back to the original note it is replying to.
